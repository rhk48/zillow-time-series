This project analyzes a series of time series models to provide a real estate investment firm to break into the Texas housing market. Based on a series of filtering, we found that the top 5 zipcodes are:  
- 76108: Fort Worth (Dallas area)
- 75052: Grand Prairie (Dallas area)
- 75104: Cedar Hill (Dallas area)
- 77571: La Porte (Houston area)
- 79423: Lubbock (Northern area)
  
# Business Understanding
As independent real estate consultants, we have been contrancted by Texas Real Estate Investment (TREI) to find the top 5 zip codes they should invest that would offer them the greatest investment success. Based on our clients requests, we found that looking at the Affordability Score (the score representing the ability of a home buyer to pay thier mortage), and Average Return on Investment(ROI) in a given zip code are strong indicidators of whether a homes in a given zip code is worth investing in for TREI. Our task is to identify what these top 5 zip codes are based on our predictions through a number of Time Series models and present our findings to the client.
